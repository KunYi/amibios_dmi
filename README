 This is experimental, potentially dangerous code that writes to your
 BIOS and can make your system unbootable. It's known to work in my test
 machines running AMI BIOS 4.6.4, but your milleage may vary. If you're
 unsure, don't run this code and use AMI-provided tools such as DMIDOS
 or AMIDEWIN.

                        AMIBIOS DMI update driver
                        -------------------------


This is a module that exposes a few AMI BIOS SMBIOS DMI structure fields
and allows them to be updated using AMI-specific SMI calls. It's useful
to e.g. update chassis (type 3) asset tags.

DMI fields are presented in /sys/firmware/amibios. You can read current
values and update them by reading and writing to the appropriate files.
Errors are reported in kernel messages.

Requirements:

- AMI BIOS 4.6.4 (other versions may be compatible)
- Linux 3.0 or higher


To read the current chassis asset tag:

 # cat /sys/firmware/amibios/chassis/asset_tag


To update the chassis asset tag:

 # echo "ASSET TAG TEST" > /sys/firmware/amibios/chassis/asset_tag
